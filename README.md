# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

This project was completed as part of a bootcamp learning process, designed to apply and demonstrate newly acquired skills in web development and security. The goal was to build a functional and secure web application, incorporating essential features such as user authentication, session management, and URL shortening.
